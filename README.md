# Explorative-Analysis-of-Irirs-Dataset

This is a multiclass classification problem.<br>
We are trying to use attributes of a flower to predict the species of the flower. Specifically, we aim to use the sepal length and width, as well as the petal length and width, to predict whether a flower is of type Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.<br><br>

In Conclusion...<br>
We achieved a 97.37% accuracy on the test dataset using a Logistic Regression model.
