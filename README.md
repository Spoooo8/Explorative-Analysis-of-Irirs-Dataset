This is multiclass classification problem.<br>
We are trying to use attributes of flower to predict the species of the flower. Specifically, we are trying to use the sepal length and width and the petal length and width to predict if an flower is of type Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.<br><br>

In Conclusion...<br>
We achieved a 97.37% accuracy on the test dataset using a Logistic Regression model
